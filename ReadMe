My name is Kenny Frankovich and this is my first big coding project I ever did

I got the idea from a youtube video about making AI run through a game of Monopoly, and I thought I'd try it myself and this is it.
It doesn't work super well right now but the framework is there, so if anyone has any suggestions that would be great. 
This is also my first time using GitHub, so I don't know how to use it and if I did something incorrectly with the setup of the project that would be nice to know. 
Thanks!

There are also other games you can play if you change the Run class main method to the other one that is there. 
The only other games that work as of today, 3/10/2023 are Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4.
